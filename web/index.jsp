        <h3>"Did the alpine open today?"</h3>

            <b>This application is in development</b>.  When complete, it
            will allow Whistler-Blackcomb skiers and snowboarders to determine
            what lifts were
            running on any particular day, along with the amount of accumulated,
            untouched snow potentially available.

            If you are currently thinking, "So What?", you either haven't thought
            it through well enough or you don't understand the appeal of deep
            powder and fresh tracks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Future plans include forecasting based on weather and avalanche
            rating, to answer not just the question, "Did the alpine open today,"
            but also, "Will the alpine open tomorrow?"
