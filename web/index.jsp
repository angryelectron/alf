        <h1>Alpine Lift Forecast</h1>
        
        <h2>Update for 2012-2013 Season</h2>
        <p>Whistler Blackcomb has discontinued the text version of their lift
        status page and are only supplying lift statuses via Flash.  As there currently
        is no means to retrieve and parse lift data, the Alpine Lift Forecast cannot
        provide useful data at this time.  For more information and updates, please
        visit <a href="http://angryelectron.com/projects/alpine-lift-forecast/">angryelectron.com</a>
        </p>
        
        
        <h3>"Did the alpine open today?"</h3>
        <p>
            <b>This application is in development</b>.  When complete, it
            will allow Whistler-Blackcomb skiers and snowboarders to determine
            what lifts were
            running on any particular day, along with the amount of accumulated,
            untouched snow potentially available.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are currently thinking, "So What?", you either haven't thought
            it through well enough or you don't understand the appeal of deep
            powder and fresh tracks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Future plans include forecasting based on weather and avalanche
            rating, to answer not just the question, "Did the alpine open today,"
            but also, "Will the alpine open tomorrow?"
